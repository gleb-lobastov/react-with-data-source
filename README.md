##About

_Request-kit_ is bunch of libraries to configure data flow of your project. Libraries is designed to be combined with each other, to follow different stack of technologies used in applications.

Idea, that end user would use single "out-of-the-box" lib, when inside it would import, combine and configure all required parts of _request-kit_ constructor

Currently "rest-react-redux" stack is in development.

Take a look to [react-redux combination](./packages/integration/react-redux/README.md#About)
